# Colocation Index or Coagglomeration Index
## Authorï¼š Lu Chen (Southeast University ,China) 

Industrial Colocation index is based on the researches of Billings and Johnson(2016) and Lu Chen et al.(2020). The index uses the longitude and latitude coordinates of enterprises to study the spatial group location rules among industries.

### Description
The program is based on the Wasserstein distance algorithm of machine learning, combined with Sinkhorn and entropy regularity optimization algorithm, to calculate the similarity of the two industries in the spatial distribution, and calculate the Colocation Index through Monte Carlo simulation and hypothesis test.


### Installation
